## 🎮 Game Features

- **🚗 Dynamic Traffic System** - Cars spawn randomly with varying colors and positions
- **📈 Progressive Difficulty** - Speed increases with each level completed
- **🏆 Level Progression** - Track your progress as you advance through levels
- **💥 Collision Detection** - Realistic crash detection system
- **🔄 Restart Functionality** - Press 'R' to restart anytime
- **🎨 Colorful Graphics** - Vibrant car colors and smooth animations
- **⚡ Responsive Controls** - Simple one-key movement system

## 🕹️ How to Play

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `↑` | Move turtle up |
| `R` | Restart game |
| `Q` | Quit game |

### 🎯 Objective
Help your turtle cross the road safely! Avoid the moving cars and reach the top of the screen to advance to the next level. Each level brings faster cars and greater challenges!

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.6 or higher
- Built-in `turtle` module (included with Python)

### Installation & Running

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/qusai-Kagalwala/turtle-crossing-game.git

# Navigate to project directory
cd turtle-crossing-game

# Run the game
python main.py
```

## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

### 🔧 Core Classes

| Class | Purpose | Key Methods |
|-------|---------|-------------|
| `Player` | Controls turtle movement | `move_up()`, `is_at_finish_line()`, `go_to_start()` |
| `CarManager` | Manages car spawning/movement | `create_car()`, `move_cars()`, `increase_speed()` |
| `Scoreboard` | Handles UI and level tracking | `increase_level()`, `game_over()`, `reset()` |

### 🎯 Game Flow
1. **Initialize** - Set up screen, player, cars, and scoreboard
2. **Game Loop** - Continuous cycle of:
   - Car spawning and movement
   - Collision detection
   - Level progression checks
3. **Game Over** - Display restart options
4. **Restart** - Reset all game components

## 🛠️ Technical Implementation

### Key Features Implemented:
- **Object-Oriented Design** - Clean separation of concerns
- **Event-Driven Programming** - Keyboard input handling
- **Game State Management** - Complete restart functionality
- **Collision Detection** - Distance-based collision system
- **Progressive Difficulty** - Speed scaling with level progression

### Code Enhancements Made:
- ✅ **Complete restart system** - Full game reset without application restart
- ✅ **Organized constants** - Centralized configuration values
- ✅ **Enhanced documentation** - Comprehensive code comments
- ✅ **Improved structure** - Professional code organization

## 🎨 Customization Options

Want to modify the game? Here are some easy tweaks:

```python
# In car_manager.py - Change car colors
COLORS = ["red", "orange", "yellow", "green", "blue", "purple"]

# In car_manager.py - Adjust difficulty
STARTING_MOVE_DISTANCE = 5  # Initial car speed
MOVE_INCREMENT = 10         # Speed increase per level

# In player.py - Modify player movement
MOVE_DISTANCE = 10          # Distance moved per keypress
```
